# Flipkart-Review-Scrapper
A Python based Web Crawler for extracting Product Review and its image, to use it for Sentiment Analysis.

I have used Flask as a micro framework and BeautifulSoup as a parser for HTML. For Running it on local Server, I have used MongoDB dataBase.
With index.html file you will be able to search the item, whereas results.html file will fetch you the records of Data Scrapped from Flipkart.com 


To use this app, simply clone the repository, download MongoDb and Flask if already not Installed.
FlaskApp.py is used for running it on local server and having MongoDB as a database to remove the overhead of scrapping same Product multiple times.

Requirement.txt will help you to import the correct version of libraries used in this project.
howtorun file is added for running it on Heroku Platform. Feel Free to Contribute. For any queries contact me through vaibhavshukla2017c@gmail.com
